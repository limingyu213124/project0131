            <!-- Quick Summary -->
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The two main student visas are X1 (long-term, >180 days) and X2 (short-term, ‚â§180 days). X1 holders must apply for a residence permit after arrival; X2 is for short programmes or short exchanges.</li>
                    <li>Typical required documents include: passport, visa application form + photo, Admission Notice from your Chinese institution, and the JW201/JW202 form for study programmes admitted through official channels.</li>
                    <li>You must complete the online visa form (COVA), make an appointment (AVAS) at the Chinese embassy/consulate, submit originals in person and provide biometrics unless exempt.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>1) Which visa do I need: X1 vs X2?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>X1:</strong> For degree programmes or study longer than 180 days. After entering China on X1, you must convert the X1 visa into a residence permit at the local Exit-Entry Administration within 30 days of arrival.</li>
                <li><strong>X2:</strong> For short-term study, internships or exchange programmes no longer than 180 days. X2 is single or multiple entries depending on the consulate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2) Core documents you will usually need</h2>
            <p><em>(Consulates can vary‚Äîalways check the specific embassy/consulate page before applying.)</em></p>

            <h3>Essential (basic) items:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Passport:</strong> original, at least 6 months' validity and two blank pages; photocopy of bio-page and any recent Chinese visa pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Completed Visa Application Form (COVA):</strong> and printed Confirmation Page; signed by applicant.</li>
                <li><strong>One passport-style color photo:</strong> recent, white background‚Äîfollow consulate photo specs.</li>
                <li><strong>Proof of legal stay:</strong> in the country where you apply (if applying outside your nationality country): original and photocopy of valid visa/residence permit.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Student-specific:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Original Admission Notice:</strong> from the Chinese institution + a photocopy.</li>
                <li><strong>JW201 or JW202 form:</strong> JW201 is typically issued for government-funded scholarship students; JW202 commonly used for self-funded students admitted through official programme channels.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Other possible items (depending on embassy/programme):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Proof of funds, scholarship award letters, health insurance, and return flight or accommodation details if requested.</li>
                <li>For applicants under 18, birth certificate and parental documents may be required.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3) How to apply ‚Äî step-by-step (typical procedure)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wait for your official admission documents and JW201/JW202 (if applicable). Confirm which visa type the university recommends.</li>
                <li>Fill in the online China visa application (COVA) and print the required pages. The COVA system yields the application form and confirmation to submit in person.
                    <ul>
                        <li>COVA site: <a href="https://cova.cs.mfa.gov.cn" target="_blank">https://cova.cs.mfa.gov.cn</a> (check the embassy instructions on whether you need to use it).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Use the AVAS appointment system to book a submission slot at the embassy/consulate/visa center and print the appointment voucher.
                    <ul>
                        <li>AVAS site: <a href="https://avas.cs.mfa.gov.cn" target="_blank">https://avas.cs.mfa.gov.cn</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Prepare originals and copies of all requested documents; bring payment method for consular fee and any service-centre fees. Many embassies require in-person biometric capture (fingerprints + photo) at submission unless exempt.</li>
                <li>Attend the appointment and submit documents. If all is in order, wait for processing and collect your passport with visa. Processing times vary‚Äîapply well in advance (at least 3‚Äì4 weeks recommended, earlier if possible).</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>4) Biometric requirements and exemptions</h2>
            <p>As of the policies summarized by the Beijing service page, most visa applicants must appear in person for fingerprints and facial scans. Exemptions usually include applicants under 14 or over 70, diplomatic/service passports, or applicants whose fingerprints were already recorded for the same passport in the past 5 years, or where fingerprints are physically unavailable.</p>

            <h2>5) After arrival in China</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If you entered on an X1 visa (long-term), you must apply for a residence permit within 30 days of arrival at the Exit-Entry Administration of the local Public Security Bureau (PSB). The residence permit replaces the X1 visa as your legal stay permit while studying.</li>
                <li>Bring your passport with the X1 visa, admission notice, JW form, health checks if required by local rules, proof of address (university accommodation registration), and photographs. Universities often help with the residence-permit process and give step-by-step guidance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6) Common pitfalls and practical tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start early:</strong> gather admission documents and JW forms as soon as you accept the offer. Consulates can require weeks to process decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Always check the local Chinese embassy/consulate:</strong> requirements, fees and appointment rules vary by country and consulate. The COVA/AVAS systems are used widely but implementation details differ.</li>
                <li><strong>Originals:</strong> many documents (Admission Notice, JW201/JW202) must be original copies. Photocopies alone are often not accepted.</li>
                <li><strong>Name consistency:</strong> ensure the name on your admission documents, JW form and passport match exactly. If your passport name changed, bring official name-change records.</li>
                <li><strong>Residence permit timing:</strong> don't wait to apply for the residence permit ‚Äî missing the 30-day window can cause fines or complications.</li>
                <li><strong>Health insurance:</strong> get adequate international/student health insurance that covers you in China; some universities require proof of coverage.</li>
                <li>If applying in a third country (not your nationality country), check "proof of legal stay" requirements‚Äîbring your valid residence permit or visa for that country.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7) Typical processing timeline (example)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Receive admission + JW form:</strong> variable (university dependent)</li>
                <li><strong>Fill COVA and book AVAS appointment:</strong> 1‚Äì7 days depending on appointment availability</li>
                <li><strong>Embassy processing:</strong> commonly 5‚Äì20 working days (can be longer in busy seasons); always check the consulate's published processing times and allow buffer.</li>
                <li><strong>After arrival (X1):</strong> apply for residence permit within 30 days; processing for the residence permit may take several working days to weeks depending on locality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8) Short FAQs</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: Can I convert an X2 visa to a residence permit if my programme is extended?</h3>
                <p>A: Typically you should exit/enter or apply for a change at a local Entry-Exit authority; consult the local PSB and your university's international office for the proper procedure‚Äîrules vary.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: What if my JW201/JW202 hasn't arrived by the embassy appointment?</h3>
                <p>A: Some consulates will not accept a student visa application without the JW form. Contact your university's admissions office to request expedited issuance and check whether the consulate accepts a later submission or a conditional letter.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q: Do scholarship students use a different form?</h3>
                <p>A: Government scholarship students normally receive a JW201; many self-funded programmes use JW202. Both are types of the official "Visa Application for Study in China" issued through education authorities.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>9) Practical checklist (before you go to the embassy/consulate)</h2>
            <div class="checklist">
                <div class="checklist-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled checked> Valid passport (‚â•6 months) + photocopies of bio page and previous Chinese visa pages (if any)</div>
                <div class="checklist-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled checked> Printouts from COVA (completed & signed) and AVAS appointment voucher</div>
                <div class="checklist-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled checked> Recent passport-size photo (follow consulate specs)</div>
                <div class="checklist-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled checked> Original Admission Notice + photocopy</div>
                <div class="checklist-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled checked> Original JW201 or JW202 + photocopy (if required)</div>
                <div class="checklist-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled checked> Proof of legal stay in the country of application (if applicable)</div>
                <div class="checklist-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled checked> Scholarship letter or proof of funds (if requested)</div>
                <div class="checklist-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled checked> Fees and appropriate payment method as required by the consulate/visa center</div>
            </div>

            <h2>10) University support and local help</h2>
            <p>Most universities provide step-by-step guidance, checklists, and sometimes accompany groups to the Exit-Entry Administration for residence-permit applications. Contact your university's international students office as soon as you accept the offer.</p>
