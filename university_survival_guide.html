                <h3>Quick Answer</h3>
                <p>If you study at a mainland Chinese university, expect classes organized in 45-minute "learning hours" (often delivered as 90-minute blocks), a mix of large lectures, small seminars/tutorials and longer lab/practical sessions, and assessments driven by midterms, final exams and coursework. The reliable way to convert effort into high scores is simple: treat the syllabus as your semester roadmap, do short regular pre‑/post‑class work, practise past papers under timed conditions, and use office hours strategically.</p>
            </div>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>1. The Basic Schedule: How Time is Measured</h2>
                
                <h3>Learning Hours and Credit System</h3>
                <p>In mainland China, a "learning hour" commonly equals 45 minutes. 16 learning hours typically count as one credit in many universities, so courses are scheduled in chunks that add up to the credit total listed in the programme guide.</p>
                
                <h3>Typical Block Format</h3>
                <p>Universities often combine two learning hours into a 90‑minute teaching block (or two 45‑minute slots with a short break). Labs, studios or workshops may run for multiple continuous hours to allow setup and hands‑on work.</p>
                
                <h3>Daily Load You'll See</h3>
                <p>Undergraduates usually have 2–6 scheduled classes on a given weekday. Early years tend to be denser (more required lectures) and later years lighter but with more project work and self‑study time.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>2. The Main Course Types and What Each Expects From You</h2>
                
                <h3>Lecture (大课)</h3>
                <p>Instructor‑led delivery of core material. Expect slides, definitions, and worked examples. Best practice: quick preview (20–30 minutes) of the topic before class, focused note‑taking, and a 24‑hour review to consolidate learning.</p>
                
                <h3>Seminar / Discussion (研讨 / 讨论课)</h3>
                <p>Small‑group, discussion‑based sessions that test reading comprehension and critical thinking. Come prepared with notes and 1–2 questions or points to share.</p>
                
                <h3>Tutorial / Recitation (习题课)</h3>
                <p>Problem sessions, often TA‑led, where you practice methods step by step. Bring attempted solutions and explicit questions—these sessions are where method details are clarified.</p>
                
                <h3>Lab / Practical / Studio (实验/上机/工作室)</h3>
                <p>Attendance, procedure and lab reports usually count toward the final grade. Document results carefully (photos/screenshots) and follow report templates exactly.</p>
                
                <h3>Project / Presentation / Group Work (课程设计、陈述、团队项目)</h3>
                <p>Assessment here rewards planning, demonstrable individual contribution and polished delivery. Early, transparent division of labour and project logs protect your share of the grade.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>3. How Courses Are Assessed (Typical Breakdowns)</h2>
                
                <h3>Common Weightings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Final exam: 40–70%</li>
                    <li>Midterm(s): 10–30%</li>
                    <li>Coursework/essays/reports: 10–30%</li>
                    <li>Lab/practical: 5–20%</li>
                    <li>Participation/attendance: 0–10%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Always confirm weights in the course syllabus.</p>
                
                <h3>Exam Formats You'll Meet</h3>
                <p>Closed‑book invigilated finals remain the standard for many core modules; others use open‑book exams, take‑home assignments, online quizzes or continuous assessment—especially for professional or applied courses.</p>
                
                <h3>Grading Systems</h3>
                <p>Some schools use percentage/100‑point scales, others use GPA or letter conversions. Top universities may have bespoke conversion rules—again, check the departmental handbook for exact practice.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>4. Term‑Time Study Practices That Prevent Panic</h2>
                
                <h3>Syllabus = Contract</h3>
                <p>On week one, transfer deadlines and weightings from the syllabus into a semester calendar. Highlight high‑weight assessments and reverse‑plan them from the deadline.</p>
                
                <h3>The Preview/Attend/Review Loop</h3>
                <p>20–30 minutes preview → focused class notes → within‑24‑hour review. This short loop converts lecture input into durable recall and drastically reduces exam cramming.</p>
                
                <h3>Annotated Bibliography Habit</h3>
                <p>For essay or take‑home work, keep one sentence summaries and one line on usefulness for each source; it saves hours when you draft citations.</p>
                
                <h3>Small Weekly Milestones</h3>
                <p>Break projects into weekly micro‑tasks (research, outline, first draft, revision) and schedule them as non‑negotiable calendar events.</p>

                <h2>5. How to Approach Each Exam Type (Practical, Actionable)</h2>
                
                <h3>Closed‑Book, Invigilated Exams (Most Finals)</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Four‑Week Reverse Plan</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Week -4:</strong> Collect past papers and marking rubrics</li>
                        <li><strong>Week -3:</strong> Practise timed questions</li>
                        <li><strong>Week -2:</strong> Take two full timed mocks</li>
                        <li><strong>Week -1:</strong> Focused weak‑spot work + formula/definition cards</li>
                        <li><strong>Day before:</strong> Light review and rest</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p><strong>In the exam:</strong> Skim the whole paper, mark high‑value questions to attempt first, show full working for partial credit, and leave time for a final check. Use headings and numbered steps so markers can award partial marks easily.</p>
                
                <h3>Open‑Book / Take‑Home / Report Assessments</h3>
                <p>Depth > memory: concentrate on argument, method and limitations. Build a short annotated bibliography early; draft, rest a day, and revise for clarity and citations. Keep raw data and version history.</p>
                
                <h3>Labs / Practicals</h3>
                <p>Follow procedures exactly, collect photographic evidence and timestamps, and write reports to the required template. In the discussion section, include error analysis and a concrete improvement idea—markers reward critical reflection.</p>
                
                <h3>Presentations and Group Projects</h3>
                <p>Rehearse, time your slides, and keep a one‑page contribution log describing what you delivered. If peer marks are used, keep communication records to evidence your role.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>6. Class‑Time Behaviors and Small Habits That Lift Grades</h2>
                
                <h3>Attend and Engage</h3>
                <p>Participation often ties to marks and, regardless, boosts understanding. Even short, thoughtful comments matter in seminars.</p>
                
                <h3>Use Office Hours Routinely</h3>
                <p>A 10–15 minute meeting to clarify expectations or get feedback on a draft both improves work and signals engagement to instructors. Send a short agenda 24–48 hours before the meeting.</p>
                
                <h3>Focused Study Groups</h3>
                <p>Teach one another—explaining a concept aloud quickly exposes gaps and cements knowledge. Run timed mock exams together under exam conditions.</p>
                
                <h3>Follow Formal Submission Rules</h3>
                <p>Late penalties and format rejections are common—submit in the required format, on time, with filenames as requested.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>7. Academic Integrity and Exam Rules (Don't Gamble Here)</h2>
                
                <p>Mainland universities enforce strict rules on cheating and fabricated data; consequences include course failure, disciplinary action and, in extreme cases, loss of student status. Read the student management/examination regulations for your school and treat them as binding.</p>
                
                <p>For writing: always cite, and when paraphrasing, change wording and structure and still credit the source. Use the writing centre and anti‑plagiarism tutorials many universities provide.</p>

                    <li>Timetables can be tight between buildings—factor 10–20 minutes for walking on large campuses and check if your school shortens class length to manage student flow.</li>
                    <li>Course forms and specific rubrics differ by department: always use the course's official syllabus and the department's grade conversion table as the final authority.</li>
