            <p>China's rapidly growing economy and dynamic job market present a wealth of opportunities for international students. With a unique blend of traditional culture and modern innovation, working in China can be a rewarding experience. However, navigating the job market as a foreigner can be challenging. This comprehensive guide will provide you with essential information, from legal requirements to the most effective job search platforms, to help you land your dream job in the Middle Kingdom.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Understanding the Legal Landscape: Visas and Work Permits</h2>
            <p>Before you start your job search, it's crucial to understand the legal requirements for foreigners working in China. The primary document you'll need is a Z-visa, which is the work visa. For comprehensive visa information, check our <a href="student_visa_guide.html">student visa guide</a> and <a href="index.html">university selector tool</a> to explore your options.</p>
            
            <h3>The Z-Visa Process</h3>
            <p>Here's a general overview of the work visa process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Job Offer:</strong> First, you need to secure a job offer from a company in China that is licensed to hire foreigners.</li>
                <li><strong>Work Permit Notification:</strong> Your employer will then apply for a Work Permit Notification on your behalf from the local labor bureau.</li>
                <li><strong>Z-Visa Application:</strong> With the Work Permit Notification, you can apply for a Z-visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate in your home country.</li>
                <li><strong>Residence Permit:</strong> Once you arrive in China, you'll need to apply for a Residence Permit within 30 days. This permit allows you to live and work in China for the duration of your contract.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="important-note">
                <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> It is illegal to work in China on a student visa (X-visa) or a tourist visa (L-visa). Some students may be eligible for internships, but these are typically arranged through their university and have specific regulations. Always ensure you have the correct visa before starting any work.</p>
