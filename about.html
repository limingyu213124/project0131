        <section class="about-section">
            <h2>China University Selector</h2>
            <p>China University Selector is a comprehensive, free online platform designed specifically for international students seeking higher education opportunities in China. Our mission is to bridge the gap between global students and Chinese universities by providing accurate, up-to-date information and personalized recommendations through an innovative interactive quiz system.</p>

            <p>Founded with the understanding that choosing the right university is one of the most critical decisions in a student's academic journey, we've developed a sophisticated matching algorithm that considers multiple factors including academic interests, budget constraints, location preferences, language requirements, and career aspirations. Our platform features detailed profiles of top Chinese universities, comprehensive application guides, and real-time information about programs, fees, and admission requirements.</p>

            <p>What sets China University Selector apart is our commitment to providing completely free, unbiased information. We believe that quality education guidance should be accessible to all students, regardless of their financial background. Our platform is regularly updated with the latest information from official university sources, ensuring that students receive accurate and current data to make informed decisions about their academic future in China.</p>

            <p>The platform serves as a comprehensive resource hub, offering not just university matching services, but also detailed guides on visa applications, scholarship opportunities, cultural adaptation, and practical tips for living and studying in China. We understand that studying abroad involves more than just academic considerations, which is why we provide holistic support to help students navigate every aspect of their educational journey in China.</p>

            <ul>
