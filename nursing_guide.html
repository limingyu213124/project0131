                <h2>Why Study Nursing in China?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Large clinical systems and teaching hospitals</strong> give students broad clinical exposure. The global nursing workforce is growing, but regional gaps remain, which makes well-designed nursing education valuable for graduates seeking international or local careers.</li>
                    <li><strong>English-taught programs available</strong> at several Chinese universities with clear international admissions processes, which helps non-Chinese speakers apply and enroll.</li>
                    <li><strong>Affordable costs</strong> compared with Western countries. Tuition and living costs in many Chinese programs can be more affordable, and some universities offer <a href="csc_scholarship_guide.html">scholarships for international students</a>.</li>
                </ul>
