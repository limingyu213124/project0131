                <p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong> BLCU's main campus dorms are on the Haidian (Xueyuan Road) campus. Official dorm types are commonly shared rooms (3-, 4-, 6-person), with graduate dorm fees published in a low annual range. The university runs an online bed-selection system, requires signed accommodation agreements at check-in, provides only mattresses in rooms, and arranges certified vendors to sell bedding during move-in. Campus dining, sports facilities and a campus hospital are available nearby.</p>

                <h3>Use the Bed-Selection System Proactively</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practice during the simulation window and be ready at the formal selection time</li>
                    <li>Auto-assignment often gives less favorable beds (lower floor, farther from bathroom)</li>
                    <li>Download and keep the signed accommodation agreement PDF‚Äîit's required at check-in</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Money & Billing</h3>
                <p>Budget for additional costs beyond dormitory fees:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deposits and bedding costs</li>
                    <li>Campus card top-up</li>
                    <li>Utilities if billed separately</li>
                    <li>Incidental move-in purchases</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Keep receipts and payment screenshots for your records.</p>

                <h3>Health & Safety</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Save the campus hospital number and local emergency contacts to your phone before arrival</li>
                    <li>Note campus medical resources and emergency procedures</li>
                    <li>Register for campus health services upon arrival</li>

                <h3>Documentation and Evidence Retention</h3>
                <p>Save screenshots/emails of your bed selection, accommodation agreement, payment confirmations and any official communications. If a problem arises later (wrong assignment, fee dispute), these are your strongest evidence.</p>
