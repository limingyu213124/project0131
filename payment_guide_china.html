            <div class="article-intro">
                <p>China is highly digital: QR payments (Alipay, WeChat Pay) dominate daily life in cities. But many international visitors find the first week awkward unless they plan ahead. This guide tells you exactly what to do from arrival to daily spending, whether you're a tourist, student, or new resident.</p>
            </div>

            <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                    <p>China's payment landscape is unique compared to most countries. While cash and international cards work in some places, QR code payments through Alipay and WeChat Pay are the standard for daily transactions. Understanding these systems before you arrive will save you time, money, and frustration.</p>
                    
                    <p>For international students planning to study in China, having the right payment setup is crucial for everything from paying tuition fees to buying groceries. This guide covers all the essential payment methods and how to set them up properly.</p>

                    <h2>Basic Payment Options ‚Äî What You'll Actually Use</h2>
                    
                    <div class="payment-method">
                        <h3>üíµ Cash (CNY)</h3>
                        <p>Still useful in small towns, night markets, and some taxis. Exchange at banks/airport counters or withdraw from ATMs with a passport; fees and rates vary so compare options.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Best for: Small vendors, rural areas, emergency situations</li>
                            <li>Where to get: Banks, airport counters, ATMs</li>

                        <h3>üí≥ International Cards & ATMs</h3>
                        <p>Major Chinese bank ATMs (Bank of China, ICBC, CCB) accept Visa/MasterCard and UnionPay; expect ATM withdrawal fees from your bank and sometimes local ATM fees.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Best for: ATM withdrawals, some hotels and restaurants</li>
                            <li>Limitations: Not accepted everywhere, especially small vendors</li>

                    <div class="setup-step">
                        <h3>Step 1: Before Arrival</h3>
                        <p>Download both apps (Alipay and WeChat) and register with your phone number. English interfaces are available.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Download from official app stores only</li>
                            <li>Use your international phone number initially</li>
                            <li>Enable English language settings</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="setup-step">
                        <h3>Step 2: Real-Name Verification</h3>
                        <p>In-app you'll be asked for passport details for identity verification. This unlocks basic payment features.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Have your passport ready</li>
                            <li>Take clear photos of passport pages</li>
                            <li>Verification usually takes 1-3 business days</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="setup-step">
                        <h3>Step 3: Link an International Card</h3>
                        <p>You can link Visa or Mastercard; that usually enables card payments and online purchases. Important limits: many foreign cards can be used for direct payments but cannot top up a local wallet balance or transfer to Chinese bank accounts unless you link a Chinese bank card.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Supports most major international cards</li>
                            <li>Enables merchant payments</li>

                    <div class="setup-step">
                        <h3>Step 4: For Full Functionality</h3>
                        <p>For full functionality (wallet top-up, person-to-person transfers, some services) you need a Chinese bank account and a UnionPay debit card; universities and employers can help you open one after arrival.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Required for: Wallet top-ups, P2P transfers, some services</li>
                            <li>Universities often help students open accounts</li>
                            <li>Brings full payment ecosystem access</li>

                    <div class="workflow-step">

                        <p>If you plan to study or live in China long-term, open a Chinese bank account within the first week (you'll need passport, visa and often campus or address proof). A local account removes most limits.</p>

                    <h2>Final Note</h2>
                    <p>For short trips, rely on a combination of a small cash stash, an international card and pre-set Alipay/WeChat for card payments. For study or work, open a Chinese bank account as soon as possible ‚Äî that removes most friction and unlocks full wallet features.</p>
