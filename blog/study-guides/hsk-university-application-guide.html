<p>For international students aspiring to study in China, demonstrating Chinese language proficiency is a crucial part of the university application process. The most widely accepted certification for this is the <strong>H√†ny«î Shu«êp√≠ng K«éosh√¨ (HSK)</strong>, or the Chinese Proficiency Test. This guide provides an overview of the HSK, the different levels, and the typical requirements for applying to Chinese universities.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
<h2 id="what-is-hsk">What is the HSK?</h2>
<p>The HSK is an international standardized test that assesses the Chinese language proficiency of non-native speakers. It is developed by the Center for Language Education and Cooperation (CLEC) and is recognized by universities and employers worldwide. The HSK is divided into a written test and an oral test (HSKK), which are independent of each other.</p>
<h3>The Written Test (HSK)</h3>
<p>The current HSK written test (often referred to as HSK 2.0) is structured into six levels, with Level I being the most basic and Level VI the most advanced. Each level corresponds to a certain level of language competency:</p>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>HSK Level</th><th>Vocabulary</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Level I</strong></td><td>150 words</td><td>Can understand and use very simple Chinese words and phrases.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Level II</strong></td><td>300 words</td><td>Can communicate in a simple and direct manner on familiar daily topics.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Level III</strong></td><td>600 words</td><td>Can use Chinese to serve the needs of their personal life, studies and work, and are capable of completing most of the communicative tasks they experience during their travel in China.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Level IV</strong></td><td>1,200 words</td><td>Can converse in Chinese on a wide range of topics and are able to communicate fluently with native Chinese speakers.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Level V</strong></td><td>2,500 words</td><td>Can read Chinese newspapers and magazines, enjoy Chinese films and plays, and give a full-length speech in Chinese.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Level VI</strong></td><td>5,000+ words</td><td>Can easily comprehend written and spoken information in Chinese and can effectively express themselves in Chinese, both orally and on paper.</td></tr>
<tbody>
</table>
<h3>The Oral Test (HSKK)</h3>
<p>The HSKK (H√†ny«î Shu«êp√≠ng K«íuy«î K«éosh√¨) assesses oral proficiency and is divided into three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HSKK (Primary)</strong></li>
<li><strong>HSKK (Intermediate)</strong></li>
<li><strong>HSKK (Advanced)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some universities may require an HSKK certificate in addition to the HSK written test, especially for programs that require strong communication skills.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
<h2 id="hsk-3-0">The New HSK 3.0 Standard</h2>
<p>A new HSK standard, known as <strong>HSK 3.0</strong>, has been introduced. This new framework is structured into ‚Äúthree stages and nine levels,‚Äù with the addition of an advanced level (Levels 7-9). While the new standard is being gradually implemented, the <strong>six-level HSK 2.0 is still the most commonly required standard for university admissions in 2025 and 2026</strong>. It is important to check the specific requirements of the universities you are applying to, as some may start to adopt the new standard.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
<h2 id="requirements">HSK Requirements for University Admission</h2>
<p>The HSK level required for university admission in China depends on the university, the program of study, and the language of instruction.</p>
<h3>Chinese-Taught Programs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Undergraduate Programs:</strong> Most universities require a minimum of <strong>HSK Level 4</strong>. For more competitive universities and programs, such as those in the humanities, business, and social sciences, <strong>HSK Level 5</strong> is often required.</li>
<li><strong>Graduate Programs (Master's and PhD):</strong> The requirements are generally higher for graduate studies. Most universities require <strong>HSK Level 5 or HSK Level 6</strong> for admission to Master's and PhD programs taught in Chinese.</li>
</ul>
<h3>English-Taught Programs</h3>
<p>For programs taught in English, HSK is not always a mandatory requirement for admission. However, having an HSK certificate can be a significant advantage. Some universities may still require a basic HSK level (e.g., HSK 3 or 4) as a graduation requirement, even for students in English-taught programs. This is to ensure that students have a basic understanding of Chinese for daily life in China.</p>
<h3>HSK Requirements for Top Universities (Guidelines)</h3>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>University</th><th>Undergraduate (Chinese-Taught)</th><th>Graduate (Chinese-Taught)</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Peking University</strong></td><td>HSK 6 (score ‚â• 210)</td><td>HSK 6 (score ‚â• 210)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Tsinghua University</strong></td><td>HSK 5 (each ‚â• 60) or HSK 6</td><td>HSK 5 or HSK 6</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Fudan University</strong></td><td>HSK 5 or 6</td><td>HSK 6</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</strong></td><td>HSK 5</td><td>HSK 5 or 6</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Zhejiang University</strong></td><td>HSK 4 or 5</td><td>HSK 5 or 6</td></tr>

            <section class="content-section">
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aim for a Higher Score:</strong> Even if a university's minimum requirement is HSK 4, aiming for HSK 5 or 6 will make your application more competitive and will better prepare you for academic life in China.</li>
<li><strong>Check Specific Program Requirements:</strong> Always check the specific HSK requirements for the program you are interested in, as they can vary significantly even within the same university.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare for the HSKK:</strong> Consider taking the HSKK oral test, as it can be a valuable addition to your application, especially for programs that require strong communication skills.</li>
<li><strong>Start Preparing Early:</strong> Preparing for the HSK takes time and dedication. Start studying well in advance of your application deadline.</li>
